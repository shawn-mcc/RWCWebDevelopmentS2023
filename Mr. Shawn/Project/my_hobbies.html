                <p>Smite is one of my favorite video games, and I've been playing for about 6 years now. I've gone to several torunaments to compete with pro players. It's by far my favorite way to relax at home. </p>
    <h2>About Smite</h2>
    <p>Smite is a free-to-play, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game. In Smite, players control a god, goddess or other mythological figure and take part in team-based combat, using their abilities and tactics against other player-controlled gods and non-player-controlled minions.</p>
    <h2>My Favorite Character: Nox</h2>
    <p>Nox is a character in Smite that I enjoy playing. She is a Roman Mage with ranged magical abilities.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Playing Nox</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>A common combo for Nox is to use her second ability, Siphon Darkness, to create a void of darkness that silences and damages all enemies within the area. Then, while the enemies are silenced, use her first ability, Shadow Lock, to root and cripple them in place while dealing additional damage over time.</li>

        <li>Nox's ultimate ability, Night Terror, not only deals damage to all enemies in the area but also reduces their damage output for a short time. This can be useful for turning the tide of a team fight or for protecting your allies from incoming damage.</li>

        <li>Nox's third ability, Shadow Step, can also be used offensively. If carefully aimed and timed, it can potentially hit enemies twice - once when dashing forward and entering into the shadow of an enemy god and again when dashing out of their shadow.</li>
