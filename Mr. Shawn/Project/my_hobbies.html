                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! My name is Shawn and I am a 24 year old college student studying Information Technology at
                    NJIT. I
                    was born in Philly and raised in South Jersey. I am excited to be teaching this class on Web
                    Development
                    with RWC, as I
                    have a lot of experiance in this field. I'm also super happy to be able to give back, as when I was
                    in
                    middle and high school,
                    I also participated in similar programs to RWC. I love teaching and programming, so choosing to
                    teach
                    this track was a no brainer. </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my life, I have been involved in various technology-related activities. When I was in
                    high
                    school, I was the programming captain of our FIRST robotics team, which made it to World
                    Championships
                    and
                    placed 7th in the world. When I made it to college, I became a member of NJIT's cybersecurity club,
                    and
                    also represented NJIT
                    at MIT's Hackathon, where my team and I placed 11th out of 80 teams. Besides academia, I also have
                    found
                    ways to incorporate my tech skills at work.
                    I've worked for Best Buy since I was 16, and spent a long time being a Repair Agent for the Geek
                    Squad
                    before I was promoted to a manager.</p>
                <p>
                    Programming has always been a passion of mine, ever since I was 11 years old. I built my first
                    website
                    when I was 13 and have been fascinated with web development ever since. Additionally, I have been a
                    gamer practically my whole life and follow the video game scene very closely and spent a couple of
                    years
                    as a critic for new games that were coming out. </p>

                <p>
                    As a senior at NJIT, I am excited to graduate and get involved in the digital forensics field. In
                    the
                    long-term, I hope to attend law school as I believe our legal system needs to reflect the modern
                    technology that makes up our everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope this introduction gives you a better idea of who I am and what I am passionate about. I look
                    forward to working with you all and helping you learn more about web development.
                </p>
