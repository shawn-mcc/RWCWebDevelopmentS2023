    Hi there! My name is Shawn and I am a 23 year old college student studying Information Technology at
                    NJIT. I
                    was born in Philly and raised in South Jersey. I am excited to be teaching this class on Web
                    Development
                    with RWC, as I
                    have a lot of experiance in this field. I'm also super happy to be able to give back, as when I was
                    in
                    middle and high school,
                    I also participated in similar programs to RWC. I love teaching and programming, so choosing to
                    teach
                    this track was a no brainer.
